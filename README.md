## 📌 Objective

- Explore UK road accident data
- Analyze accidents by:
  - Time of day
  - Weather conditions
  - Light & road surface
  - Urban vs. rural areas
- Map accident locations using geographic coordinates

---

## 📊 Key Analyses

- Time-of-day histogram for accident trends
- Count plots for:
  - Weather Conditions
  - Road Surface
  - Light Conditions
  - Urban/Rural divide
- Geographic accident mapping using `Plotly`

---

## 🌍 Key Insights

- Accidents peak during **commute hours (8–9 AM & 5–6 PM)**
- Bad **weather and road surface conditions** significantly increase accident counts
- Urban areas have more accidents due to dense traffic
- Mapping using `Plotly` showed clear geographic clustering

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn & Matplotlib  
- Plotly Express  
- Jupyter Notebook
